HellowDarwin* aims to be a rebased fork derived of HelloSystem but onto all Darwin works that are still FOSS-Compatible. Any missing impelementations such as CoreAudio-Related code from Current Works are intended to be ported and brought older from older versions where possible and if not, then ported and brought over from FreeBSD to fill in

Note: 
 Not to be confused with the "PureDarwin" Project which moved from https://code.google.com/p/puredarwin/ 

 (PureDarwin is a community project that aims to make Darwin more usable and the successor to OpenDarwin. The current goal of this project is to provide a useful bootable ISO/VM of Darwin 10.x , 
  Also Darwin is the Open Source operating system from Apple that forms the basis for multiple OS's + PureDarwin Code.
