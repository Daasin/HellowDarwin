==========
HellowDarwin aims to be a rebased fork of HelloSystem but onto all Darwin works that are still FOSS-Compatible. Any missing impelementations such as CoreAudio-Related code from Current Works are intended to be ported and brought older from older versions where possible and if not, then ported and brought over from FreeBSD to fill in

Darwin is the Open Source operating system from Apple that forms the basis for multiple OS's and PureDarwin. PureDarwin is a community project that aims to make Darwin more usable (some people think of it as the informal successor to OpenDarwin). The current goal of this project is to provide a useful bootable ISO/VM of Darwin 10.x
